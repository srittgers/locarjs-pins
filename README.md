This app allows the user to set pins and then see a floating red pin with a label.  (it uses local storage to save the pins)

It uses locar.js which works on iphones too (not using webxr)

To run the app:
1. maybe do "npm install" (not sure if this happens automatically when project loads)
2. "npm run dev" (this calls "vite dev")
(there is also "npm run build" which calls "vite build" but I think maybe "run dev" does that?)
